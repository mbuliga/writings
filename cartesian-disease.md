**On the cartesian disease**

\

The wording "cartesian disease" means an abuse or misuse of the
cartesian method. I shall use in the argumentation the final section,
because there is a concentrate of the method, formulated in such a
precise, equilibrated and astonishingly actual words.

\

The abuse of some part of the method consists in the excess of use of
one ingredient, in parallel with a lack of use of another ingredient
provided by Descartes' method.

\

In the following are examples of cartesian disease, listed according to
the place in the citation which is relevant for the abuse characteristic
in the respective example. (Please read, however, the whole text in
order to identify the countermeasures which the respective abuses
ignore.)

\

   - architectural constructs where many, if not most, of people
live. The relevant citation from Descartes is:

> "Thus it is observable that the buildings which a single architect has
> planned and executed, are generally more elegant and commodious than
> those which several have attempted to improve, by making old walls
> serve for purposes for which they were not originally built. Thus
> also, those ancient cities which, from being at first only villages,
> have become, in course of time, large towns, are usually but ill laid
> out compared with the regularity constructed towns which a
> professional architect has freely planned on an open plain; so that
> although the several buildings of the former may often equal or
> surpass in beauty those of the latter, yet when one observes their
> indiscriminate juxtaposition, there a large one and here a small, and
> the consequent crookedness and irregularity of the streets, one is
> disposed to allege that chance rather than any human will guided by
> reason must have led to such an arrangement." 

Horror, boredom, social problems appeared from living in such
functionally designed, but culturally void places, despite the good will
of the creators.

\

   - the cohort of dictators, along with their respective ideologies,
specific to the 20th century. The relevant citation from Descartes is:

> "In the same way I fancied that those nations which, starting from a
> semi-barbarous state and advancing to civilization by slow degrees,
> have had their laws successively determined, and, as it were, forced
> upon them simply by experience of the hurtfulness of particular crimes
> and disputes, would by this process come to be possessed of less
> perfect institutions than those which, from the commencement of their
> association as communities, have followed the appointments of some
> wise legislator."

\

   - giving value to uninformed, ignorant common sense, encouraging
simple reasoning, hence less energy consuming, more viral, over more
sophisticated reasoning. Devaluing knowledge. The relevant citation from
Descartes is:

> "In the same way I thought that the sciences contained in books (such
> of them at least as are made up of probable reasonings, without
> demonstrations), composed as they are of the opinions of many
> different individuals massed together, are farther removed from truth
> than the simple inferences which a man of good sense using his natural
> and unprejudiced judgment draws respecting the matters of his
> experience."

   - the almost eradication of geometrical thinking in mathematical
education and research, performed mainly in the 20th century, with great
success. The relevant citation from Descartes is:

> "Then as to the analysis of the ancients and the algebra of the
> moderns, besides that they embrace only matters highly abstract, and,
> to appearance, of no use, the former is so exclusively restricted to
> the consideration of figures, that it can exercise the understanding
> only on condition of greatly fatiguing the imagination; and, in the
> latter, there is so complete a subjection to certain rules and
> formulas, that there results an art full of confusion and obscurity
> calculated to embarrass, instead of a science fitted to cultivate the
> mind."

\

   - running for the ultimate explanation, for the grand theory of
everything, ultimately confusing the compression technique which is the
cartesian method, designed for being able to fit into our small brains
this huge reality at once, with the reality itself. The relevant
citation from Descartes is:

> "The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not
> clearly know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid
> precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my
> judgement than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly
> as to exclude all ground of doubt."

\

   - abuse of division, creation of a myriad of problems, which is a
tremendously efficient technique for advancing little by little our
understanding of something, but it has the disadvantage of giving the
impression that said problems are the goal and not just a mean for
understanding. Excessive division of research interests. A very good
resource for nowadays publishers, as well as for thousands and thousands
of researchers specialized into solving problems for the sake of it. The
relevant passage from Descartes is:

> " The second, to divide each of the difficulties under examination
> into as many parts as possible, and as might be necessary for its
> adequate solution."

\

   - using, for compression needs, of an unnecessary and unnatural one
dimensional formulation of understanding and then thinking exclusively
in such terms, forgetting that this streaming is a technique for easier
understanding and not a part of the subject of the study. This abuse is
present everywhere in CS and probably is the main barrier in front of a
better understanding of how the brain, or more generally how the living
world works. Neurons have "tasks", edges "are detected" and so on. The
relevant passage from Descartes is:

> "...  assigning in thought a certain order even to those objects which
> in their own nature do not stand in a relation of antecedence and
> sequence. And the last, in every case to make enumerations so
> complete, and reviews so general, that I might be assured that nothing
> was omitted."

\

\

\

\

**More on the cartesian method and it's associated disease**

\

The cartesian method, as described by the passage by Descartes from the
final section, is basically a technique of compression and analysis.
From wikipedia:

\

>    Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance
> into smaller parts to gain a better understanding of it. The technique
> has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before
> Aristotle (384--322 B.C.), though analysis as a formal concept is a
> relatively recent development.\[1\]

> \

>    Some word is from the Ancient Greek ἀνάλυσις (analusis, "a breaking
> up", from ana- "up, throughout" and lysis "a loosening").\[2\]

> \

>    As a formal concept, the method has variously been ascribed to
> Alhazen,\[3\] René Descartes (Discourse on the Method), and Galileo
> Galilei. It has also been ascribed to Isaac Newton, in the form of a
> practical method of physical discovery (which he did not name or
> formally describe).

\

The four rules of the cartesian methods are:

\

>    The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not
> clearly know to be such; that is to say, carefully to avoid
> precipitancy and prejudice, and to comprise nothing more in my
> judgement than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly
> as to exclude all ground of doubt.

>    The second, to divide each of the difficulties under examination
> into as many parts as possible, and as might be necessary for its
> adequate solution.

>    The third, to conduct my thoughts in such order that, by commencing
> with objects the simplest and easiest to know, I might ascend by
> little and little, and, as it were, step by step, to the knowledge of
> the more complex; assigning in thought a certain order even to those
> objects which in their own nature do not stand in a relation of
> antecedence and sequence.

>    And the last, in every case to make enumerations so complete, and
> reviews so general, that I might be assured that nothing was omitted.

\

In order to justify my claim that the cartesian method is an analysis
(or compression) technique, I shall comment these rules one by one.

\

1\. this rule is made by several parts:

\

>    "never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to
> be such"

>    "to comprise nothing more in my judgement than what was presented
> to my mind"

>    "so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt"

\

The first part looks like a thinking hygiene: be sure about your
hypotheses.

\

The second part has to do with the limitations of our brains capacity to
process a complex topic. As such, these limitation have nothing to do
with the topic under study. Of course we can't advance our understanding
of a subject if we can't wholly grasp it in our minds. However, is
important to remember that when we splice it in smaller, more
understandable parts, we introduce an element which has nothing to do
with the subject of study, but with our capacity of understanding (and
our prejudices, indeed, as witnessed by the fact that the same research
subject is spliced differently in different epochs or places, according
to cultural prejudices and not biological "computing power" reasons).

\

The third part has entirely to do with our limitations. In order to
understand the topic, we have to use techniques which "exclude all
ground of doubt". The great importance of doubt as a tool for
understanding is one of the most viral parts of the cartesian method. It
is one of the main ingredients of the scientific method.

\

\

2\. two parts here as well:

\

>    "to divide each of the difficulties under examination into as many
> parts as possible"

>    "and as might be necessary for its adequate solution"

\

While the first part is clearly an analysis technique, the second part
tell that the purpose of understanding is to find a solution for a
sequence of problems. Each small part, each difficulty has to be solved.
To make a comparison, say that we have a huge cake to eat, so we chip at
it with our small mouths, claiming that our goal is to well chew each
bite.

\

This is a compression technique: we divide the cake into bites, then, as
we chew each bite, we forget about the others. The bad part is that the
cake is not just the sum of the bites.

\

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\

3\. This is the most problematic rule, because here is given total
priority to the understanding over the subject of understanding. The
analysis and compression technique from the rule 2 is taken to extreme:
first is suggested something like an eager evaluation

\

>    "to conduct my thoughts in such order that"

>    "by commencing with objects the simplest and easiest to know, I
> might ascend \[...\] to the knowledge of the more complex"

>    "little and little, and, as it were, step by step"

\

... then, in order to be sure that the eager evaluation works,

\

>    "assigning in thought a certain order even to those objects which
> in their own nature do not stand in a relation of antecedence and
> sequence"

\

otherwise, who cares about the subject of understanding as long as I can
produce an working algorithm? Then, we study the algorithm and we forget
what was all this about. This looks like the most harmful part of the
cartesian method and the main source of the cartesian disease...

\

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\

4\. ... until we read the last rule:

\

>    "in every case to make enumerations so complete, and reviews so
> general, that I might be assured that nothing was omitted"

\

But if we already renounced at the subject of study and we already
(recursively) replaced it with an artificial division, enumeration and
analysis technique, this rule is only a proclamation of the superiority
of understanding of reality over the reality itself: if the
understanding of reality is internally coherent, then it is as good as
the reality itself.

\

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\

Conclusion. The cartesian method is designed as a technique for
understanding performed by one mind in isolation, severely handicapped
by the bad capacity of communication with other isolated minds. It was a
very efficient technique, which is now challenged by two effects of its
material outcomes:

\

   - better communication channels provided by the net,

   - mechanical, or should I say digital, applications of the method
which largely surpass the capacity of understanding of one human mind,
as witnessed for example by the first computer aided mathematical
proofs, or for another example by the fact that we can numerically model
physical phenomena, without understanding rigorously why the method
works.

\

**Cartesian method, scientific method and counting problems**

\

\

In my opinion, the best parts of the cartesian method are:

\

   doubt as a tool for advancing understanding, i.e this part of the
rule 1:

> "never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be
> such \[...\] to comprise \[...\] so clearly and distinctly as to
> exclude all ground of doubt",

   and this part of rule 3, taken out of context, seen as a belief, a
state of mind of the researcher:

> "by commencing with objects the simplest and easiest to know, I might
> ascend \[...\] to the knowledge of the more complex"

\

This is, in a nutshell, that part of the scientific method which apply
even to mathematicians (who don't do experiments). If there is any need
to tell, I strongly believe in the scientific method, although I
recently understood that I have problems with that parts of the
cartesian method which I now think will become obsolete, due to better
and faster communication among scientists and due to the confrontation
with big data (which will require techniques adapted to the recognition
of the fact that reality might be complex enough so that a model of it
does not fit wholly into one human brain).

\

The following are just doubts and questions which might be naive or
based on ignorance, but nevertheless I write them here, in the hope of
informed comments.

\

Remember again I am a mathematician, so maybe I disappoint some readers
(I hope not my readers) by saying that I have no problem with Cantor
diagonal argument for the proof of the fact that the set of reals is
uncountable. What makes me feel less comfortable is the impression,
which might be false, that famous theorems in logic, like Godel, or
Turing, show in fact that there are limits to the enumeration part of
the cartesian method. Am I right? To make a comparison, suppose I'am a
physicist with infinite powers and I say: I made the experiment of
counting all them Turing machines and I get results which are
contradictory with older experiments. I deduce then, by the scientific
method, that the counting procedure itself, any I might think about, is
flawed, because all the other parts have been checked independently. It
means I am not allowed to use the part of the cartesian method which
comprises enumerations if I want to understand the reality. Reality is
like this, point. If I count then I am led astray, like, as another
comparison, if I suppose that a quantum object has a arbitrarily well
localized position and moment, then I am led astray. (Not that I think
there is any connection between logic theorems based on Cantor diagonal
argument and quantum mechanics.)

\

So, what is left of logic if counting arguments are eliminated? Anybody
knows? I hope so.

\

\

\

**What is, what we understand and what we communicate about it**

\

One of the major effects of the existence of the Net is that it
challenges the cartesian method and shatters the foundations of
science. As the Net is still young and the traditions are old,
comparatively, the effect is not yet clearly identified. But it is there
already, and even if not named, it is like a secret ailment which
manifests here and there, stronger and stronger.

\

That which provokes the disease is a lack of balance in the use of the
various ingredients of the cartesian method. The disbalance is provoked
by the effort to fit what is, what we understand and what we communicate
about it into the mould of the era when the method has been invented. It
just does not fit, therefore it overflows in unexpected ways.

\

**What is.** Better is to say what is more, compared with the time when
the cartesian metod was invented. There is a new virtual world in the
making. Huge quantities of structured data, alternative worlds evolved
from seeds created by programmers, a whole new world of the Internet of
Things in the making and, further away but really close though, an
unification of the real world (defined as the one where Descartes lived
and died) with these new, emerging ones.

\

The territory, suddenly, got much bigger.

\

**What we understand.** Better to say what we understand more than
before. A huge body of scientific facts and discoveries which don't
quite fit ones with the others. Quantum mechanics with general
Relativity has become an example for old boys and girls. We have models
of the parts but we don't understand C. Elegans with its 302
neurons. There is though a building understanding of the fact that we do
understand much more, but the tools offer, each, only a limited point of
view. There are looming suspicions that data alone (what is) has more to
tell us than data filtered by a theory. We do understand, or starting to
understand that semantics is only a tool itself, a map maker, not the
territory of what is.

\

The many maps we have don't fit, we understand.

\

**What we communicate.** Better is to say that we communicate today in
unparalleled ways than before. But what we communicate is a very small,
rigidly formatted part of what we understand. It is hard to communicate
science, and the channel constraints are damaging the message.

\

We have so much to communicate and the semantic maps don't serve well
this purpose.

\

 

\

Going back at the time of the cartesian method, we see that it has been
made as a tool for isolated minds and very limited data inflow. More
than this, the cartesian method is a collection of prescriptions about
how to better understand and how to better communicate the
understanding, which makes the rational choice for those times, but an
irrational one for our times:

\

   - it privileges what we understand over what is,

  -  what we communicate over what we understand.

   Then it optimizes what we communicate for the situation of one human
mind which lays down the output in a book.

\

The book is then supposed to be distributed and multiplied by means
which are not of interest for the author, and then to hit other minds in
an unidirectional way.

\

Descartes writes a book, then somebody else writes another book where he
challenges or supports the ideas of a Dead Descartes Book, then yet
another one writes a new book which contains references to the Dead
Somebody Else Book. That's the way of the science and Descartes proposed
a wonderful path which ensures that the various Books are well written
and contain Text as a sort of a program which can be easily debugged.

\

Descartes rules apply in an indiscriminate way to what is, what we
understand and what we communicate about it.

> I had no intention on that account of attempting to master all the
> particular sciences commonly denominated mathematics: but observing
> that, however different their objects, they all agree in considering
> only the various relations or proportions subsisting among those
> objects, I thought it best for my purpose to consider these
> proportions in the most general form possible, without referring them
> to any objects in particular, except such as would most facilitate the
> knowledge of them, and without by any means restricting them to these,
> that afterwards I might thus be the better able to apply them to every

> Perceiving further, that in order to understand these relations I
> should sometimes have to consider them one by one and sometimes only
> to bear them in mind, or embrace them in the aggregate, I thought
> that, in order the better to consider them individually, I should view
> them as subsisting between straight lines, than which I could find no
> objects more simple, or capable of being more distinctly represented
> to my imagination and senses; and on the other hand, that in order to
